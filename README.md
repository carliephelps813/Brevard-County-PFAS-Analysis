# Brevard-County-PFAS-Analysis
Brevard County PFAS concentration data from Griffin, et. al. 2022 (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653522009717?via=ihub) is analyzed in this Python script. The hypothesis being tested is that PFAS concentrations and number of PFAS types are higher in the sampling locations that have more surrounding land development.
